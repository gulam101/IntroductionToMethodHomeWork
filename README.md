# IntroductionToMethodHomeWork

### Description:

This repository was created to enable me to submit my method homework

The Homework for Engineering 40 is to convert yesterday's homework into a object oriented program using classes and methods. Minimum class to be used is 2. Have 10 commits on Git. Bonus - Create an SSH connection between your local Git and your Git Hub.

### What I learnt:
- Methods
- GitHub
- How to setup a SSH connection
- OOP
- Classes

### Constraints:

This project was to follow instructions but I was new to methods and classes so I had a hard time understanding buw when I finished the project I had a better understanding of how these works.

### Improvements:

None.
